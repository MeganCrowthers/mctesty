## Welcome to the Virtual Worker

Norbert, also known as the virtual worker, is a virtual assistant that handles incoming emails for West & North Northants Council. Norbert will log them within the customer services record management system and either resolve the query with a suitable response or redirect the enquiry to someone who can review and respond.

Norbert is able to answer frequently ask questions received by their customer, enabling that 24/7 support. This includes re-direction to online services available on the authority website, as well as re direction to other sovereign authority websites, partners and organisations.

This removes the need for a customer services agent to resolve simple queries requiring an almost “pre-packaged” response and enables the customer to get an almost simultaneous reply, freeing up agents to spend their time on resolving more complex issues that require that dedicated time.
